As the title states, I've already messed up the daily part of this daily writing experiment.
But, what's the use of beating myself up over it, right?
This is probably going to be an even more rambly an incoherent post than normal, but I slept all of five hours last night.

In my defence, I spent all my free time last night finishing Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and FROM Software games require a particular investment of time and energy. Or deliberate practice, if you want to get Gladwell about it. While there tend to be parts of the games you can cheese your way through, at the end of the day, for the most part you have no choice but to knuckle down and keep trying until something clicks.

Sekiro in particular felt really tightly designed,
the scope is smaller, the world is smaller, the story and scope less byzantine.
There are fewer tools at your disposal, and everything is basically down to a handful of mechanics.
I love how some bosses feel specifically designed to teach you to master a specific mechanic.

After a dozen or so attempts, I finally defeated the final boss.
Instead of doing the sensible thing and calling it a night, I went straight into a New Game+. 
I proceeded to, over the course of three hours, to blaze through roughly half of the game, which had previously taken me several days. The additional items and damage certainly helped. But so much of it is down to timing, having learned enemies patterns, and just knowing how to play the game. 

It was a really nice way to unwind, and made me appreciate the game even more deeply.
There's still more content, a few additional bosses I could take on, some more items I could unlock. But I am not finding myself much of a completionist these days.

I would like to read more. I've done basically no real reading in the past few months, despite lockdown on paper being a really good opportunity. 
I've found myself in the slump between books.  
Re-reading seems like a bad investment when there are so many things I want to read.
But starting a new series always feels really daunting, and standalone books tend to be very hit-or-miss for me.
