The other day I saw another thread on the utility of a degree in Computer Science the other day, and I felt like taking the opportunity of writing an n+1 post detailing my own experiences.
Self-indulgent? Yes. Useful for someone? Possibly.

As I'm writing this I realise the sensible thing to do is probably to split this into several posts:

* Background (this post)
* Year 1
* Year 2
* Year 3
* Year 4
* Year 5
* Year 5.5 - Thesis
* What I Didn't Learn


### Context

At time of writing, I'm a software engineer at VMware Pivotal Labs, who's been working full-time for about two years. 
I probably would not have gotten this job without my degree. Not that VMware doesn't hire folks from "non-traditional backgrounds", but I think my life would have been significantly different, if I hadn't chosen to continue studying, or if I'd studied something other than Computer Science. 

As a Swedish citizen, my university education was free. I continued to live with my parents for the first three years of university, without paying rent, which meant that I was able to live off of grants, rather than taking loans.
During my fourth year I spent a year at the University of Tokyo, which I'm going to try and gloss over in this post to cover more in detail later. After coming home to Sweden I spent a year and a half living in student accomodation with one of my closest friends. During this time I took loans which landed me with 163,219 SEK (roughly $17,600 or £14,000). 

Compared to student debt in other countries, and taking into account our extremely low interest rates, this feels like a very small cost.
There was still an opportunity cost of course, I could have gone off and done something else. But looking back, I don't think I had many other particularly compelling options.

Having said that, going to university was definitely not a given. Neither of my parents did, and only one of my siblings had, another one of my sisters have since gone on to get a Law degree. It wasn't really something I had much awareness of at all.

Up until university, I'd always had an easy time in school, and I was repeatedly told that this was a common narrative, but that university was when the other shoe drops and you have to really work hard. So I spent a considerable amount of my first year worrying that I'd be found out as a fraud. It didn't really turn out that way, I got decent results, and continued to do so throughout my years. In spite of attending a high school that wasn't particularly rigorous in terms of academics.



### Computer Science in Engineering at KTH Royal Institute of Technology

I was admitted to my first choice of university and programme, based on my results on "Högskoleprovet" (think SAT) rather than my grades.
It is a five year combined Bachelor's and Master's. After the first three years you pick a Master's programme, we got guaranteed admittance to the Computer Science Master, but you are able to pick other ones if you take the right courses.

The school has a long history of engineering programmes, and takes a lot of pride in that.

Most people who end up dropping out do so either early on, or right at the end when they have a course or two left, or just their thesis. The people who drop out at the end tend to do so because they've already found gainful employment, and the motivation to finish the degree just isn't there anymore.

The average time to graduate is 7 years, though there's a fair amount of people who end up coming back and finishing several years later which unbalance that average somewhat. But I think this creates an environment in which taking another year or two to finish isn't frowned upon, or seen as anything out of the oridnary, which I greatly appreciated. 

The Computer Science programme in particular doesn't have much of a culture of caring about grades. While other programmes can be quite competitive, presumably because people care more about their grades, we have the relative luxury of being evaluated by prospective employers in other ways. In most cases anyway, and at least in sufficient numbers that if you do get snubbed because of your grades, there are several other companies with more sense.


### Programme Content

The syllabus is continously changing and adapting as new faculty gets hired, national requirements changes, and student preferences affect the programme. 

But the general shape of the Bachelor's programme was something like:

40% Computer Science courses
30% Mathematics
30% Others

I have things I could say about pretty much every course I took, but I'll try to be slightly more brief. 

Because of the engineering pedigree of the school, many programmes end up taking largely the same undergraduate mathematics courses. They tend to make up the bulk of failed grades as well. My cohort was the first Computer Science year that did not have Multivariate Calculus as a required course. 

This upset many a mathematics professor, and quite a few students who felt like taking that course was a rite of passage. I very much did not feel the same. Maybe I missed out. But I'm a poor mathematican at the best of times, and analysis was never my favourite branch of mathematics anyway.

Our Computer Science curriculum was pretty heavy on algorithms, theoretical computer science, and software engineering, with a lighter focus on systems programming. I haven't compared it to many other curriculums, but anecdotally our third year Algorithm course covers a lot of topics which are traditionally part of graduate courses.

The Master's Programme in Computer Science is a bit of a grab-bag, seeing as it's the default, and therefore the most common choice for students. I ended up focusing on software engineering.

### TL;DR & The Social Aspects

I think the TL;DR for all of this is going to be that I found university to be an extremely valuable experience.

I do believe that it's entirely possible for people to learn pretty much everything that is taught in the curriculum on their own. 
But I certainly couldn't, I benefitted massively from the environment, having peers to study with, a structure, assignments and exams that kept me accountable.

There are also a lot of really valuable extracurricular activities to get involved with. Swedish universities have a lot of student led organisations and interest groups. And there are lots of benefits to studying a subject which ties directly into a probably overvalued aspect of the economy. There's a lot of money flowing around, particularly from companies who want to make a good impression early on, so as to snatch up promising labour while it's cheap. Which translates into lots of lunch lectures, sponsored parties, and in one instance a course which involves companies paying for a study trip. More on that later.

There's certainly some cultish aspects to much of the social life, and there are cliques and in-groups. And it's often hard for international students to get involved, particularly as most of the activities are arranged for/by undergraduates, and in Swedish. People do care about these issues though, and are always working to improve.

It's cliche, but I did make some amazing friends, and I grew massively as a person. It also afforded me a lot of time and space to figure things out. Now, it's important to mention that that was the case because I was in the privileged position of not having to work on the side to support myself/my family, or take care of relatives, or any of the many other aspects of life that many people do have to manage as well as full-time education.
