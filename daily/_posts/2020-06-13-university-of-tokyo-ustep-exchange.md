### Preface

If you're reading this and are planning to do an exchange semester/year in Japan. I'm always more than happy to chat about this stuff. Even if you just need someone to rant to.

I started my application sometime in February 2015. My memories are a bit hazy, and I'm not particularly keen to dig to deeply into them, because frankly, just looking at the number of emails back and forth have me slightly stressed out.

If you're going as part of the Graduate Programme at the school of Information Science and Technology, as I was, you need to be accepted by a supervisor and attached to a lab. Suffice to say, I was not particularly good at writing to professors, and I don't know if most of the emails I sent were ever read.
Because I was having no luck reaching any labs, I tried applying to the School of Interdisciplinary Information Science, but that fell through, because they require you to have taken the TOEFL as proof of your English abilities.
The University of Tokyo administration staff were extremely helpful, to their credit. They managed to wrangle a professor at the IST into accepting me. Though this also meant that I had no idea what I was really getting into before I went, which was a source of not inconsiderable anxiety.

Once I had the official acceptance from the University, I could proceed with all the fun paperwork and administration involved in actually getting the visa. I've blocked most of the process out of my memory, but suffice to say, I'm not looking forward to having to do any of that again.


### Being A Graduate Student - Sort Of

There's a major disconnect between the Master's Programme at KTH and Todai. At KTH, which I was familiar with, it's largely a continuation of your Bachelor's studies, with more idependent studies. The content is certainly more academic, you are more likely to read papers than a textbook, but the structure is still very much there. I'm a person who very much needs structure in order to be productive, or at least I was at the time. I think it depends on the context as well, but at least in an academic setting, I struggle without having a clear understanding of what is expected of me.

In comparision, the courses at UTokyo can be seen as an afterthought, the primary focus of grad students is research.
With my background, I had a very limited understanding of what academic research actually looks like. I think I was still toying with the idea that it was something I wanted to do. A notion that I didn't even fully manage to dispell even after my year in Tokyo.

I will say, I did not do a good job of making use of the opportunities I had while at Todai. But I also don't think I was particularly well-placed to make use of them, so I try not to kick myself too much about it.


My first interaction with the Honiden lab was showing up to the skyscraper which housed it, going up to the floor where the professor's office was located and finding a man sleeping on a couch in the corridor. I remember feeling like the tales I'd been told about Japan's working culture seemed to be very much true. Honiden was not in his office, but one of the other professors eventually found me looking confused in the corridor and took me down several floors to where the weekly seminar was happening.

Introductions were made, very awkwardly, and I felt like people weren't really aware that I was supposed to be there.
The Spanish PhD student asked me who my supervisor was, and laughed when I said Honiden. Apparently he didn't supervise students, but left that to the other professors. The Master's student presenting that week was briefly asked if he needed to do the presentation in English, and I still remember the fear in his face. 

I didn't understand much of the presentation. I think it was on mutation testing, which I think is a fairly interesting field. But I could tell that the tone of the questions being asked were... Let's just say hostile.
I read some (Google translated) transcripts afterwards, and would later attend the seminars where the foreign students presented in English, and it generally seemed like whoever was presenting would just be torn to shreds by the professors and the other students. 

I genuinely think this combative atmosphere is one of the major reasons I was put off pursuing research. But it certainly wasn't the only reason.

Eventually I was able to have a conversation with Professor Ishikawa, who drew the short straw of supervising me, and I learned that the website of the lab was very much out of date, And that the projects that I'd thought were interesting were no longer being worked on.


### Courses - Such as they were

I had to scrape a bit to find courses given in English. I did definitely appreciate the chance to take some modules in other subjects like history and philosophy. 
But overall the quality of the courses were a bit all over the place. My biggest complaint would have been the lack of context. In many cases, the professor would show up, and just start talking from his slides, with no preface and no real indication of how anything fit together. For example, there was a course called Stochastic Methods in Mathematical Informatics, that to this day remains the most baffling hour and a half of my life. The professor was just writing out theorems for an hour and a half. I dropped that course after the first lecture.

The examination was also extremely varied. The worst offender was a course in Parallel and Distributed Computing Systems; I really enjoyed the content, even though it wasn't quite what I'd expected. But after the twelve lectures, we were given our first and only assignment: "Write a parallel program, and write a one page report on it.". 

I'm just going to go through each of the courses, some of them might still be given, and on the off-chance that someone is in the same situation that I was in, I'd like to give them just a bit more information than I had. Starting with some courses I didn't finish:

* 4820-1001 Stochastic Methods in Mathematical Informatics 
  I don't even know, according to some people who stayed, it was about using statistical methods to forecast stock markets? 

* 4860-1068 Physically Based Animation 
  A really good course covering lots of different techniques for computer based animation, with a focus on physics (gravity, lighting, etc.). I ended up dropping it because I missed some important deadlines while travelling, but it was probably the best structured course. The lecturer was really good as well.

* 4850-1007 Robotics
  Seemed to just be pure mathematics. I finally got bit by my lack of Multivariate Calculus. 

* 4810-1115 Parallel Numerical Computations
  A semi-rare instance of a course with lots of practical elements. Mostly focused around using MPI, and running on large supercomputers. I can't remember why I dropped this, I have vague memories of struggling in vain to get accounts set up.


Now for the ones I actually finished:

* Introduction to Philosophy
  An undergraduate course given by an enthusiastic professor. I mostly remember it covering ethics, and the problem of induction. He talked up the exam a lot, but it was nothing to write home about.

* Operations Research
  The only course I took given at the Komaba Campus. I appreciated learning about the Simplex method and how the computational complexity is at odds with its performance in practice. There were small weekly assignments, and I think there was even some programming involved. I think this was the only course that wasn't managed by email.

* Early Modern Philosophy 1: Rationalism (Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz)
  This was basically The Good Place, each week we'd read a text by the above mentioned philosophers, write some notes, and discuss it during a seminar. The reading was probably the most dense I've had to do. But the discussions were really nice and gave me more perspective. I also made a good friend thanks to this course. There was also a final

* Parallel and Distributed Computing Systems
  The lectures mostly talked about Dataflow Architecture, a subject that I'd never heard anything about before or since. But it was pretty neat. I just wish there'd been some exercises or something that could've helped solidify the content. Or even a textbook. As it stands I have some notes somewhere, that are not very understandable.

  To be continued.
