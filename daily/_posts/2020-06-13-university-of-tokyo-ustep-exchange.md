### Preface

If you're reading this and are planning to do an exchange semester/year in Japan. I'm always more than happy to chat about this stuff. Even if you just need someone to rant to.

I started my application sometime in February 2015. My memories are a bit hazy, and I'm not particularly keen to dig to deeply into them, because frankly, just looking at the number of emails back and forth have me slightly stressed out.

If you're going as part of the Graduate Programme at the school of Information Science and Technology, as I was, you need to be accepted by a supervisor and attached to a lab. Suffice to say, I was not particularly good at writing to professors, and I don't know if most of the emails I sent were ever read.
Because I was having no luck reaching any labs, I tried applying to the School of Interdisciplinary Information Science, but that fell through, because they require you to have taken the TOEFL as proof of your English abilities.
The University of Tokyo administration staff were extremely helpful, to their credit. They managed to wrangle a professor at the IST into accepting me. Though this also meant that I had no idea what I was really getting into before I went, which was a source of not inconsiderable anxiety.

Once I had the official acceptance from the University, I could proceed with all the fun paperwork and administration involved in actually getting the visa. I've blocked most of the process out of my memory, but suffice to say, I'm not looking forward to having to do any of that again.


### Being A Graduate Student - Sort Of

There's a major disconnect between the Master's Programme at KTH and Todai. At KTH, which I was familiar with, it's largely a continuation of your Bachelor's studies, with more idependent studies. The content is certainly more academic, you are more likely to read papers than a textbook, but the structure is still very much there. I'm a person who very much needs structure in order to be productive, or at least I was at the time. I think it depends on the context as well, but at least in an academic setting, I struggle without having a clear understanding of what is expected of me.

In comparision, the courses at UTokyo can be seen as an afterthought, the primary focus of grad students is research.
With my background, I had a very limited understanding of what academic research actually looks like. I think I was still toying with the idea that it was something I wanted to do. A notion that I didn't even fully manage to dispell even after my year in Tokyo.

I will say, I did not do a good job of making use of the opportunities I had while at Todai. But I also don't think I was particularly well-placed to make use of them, so I try not to kick myself too much about it.


My first interaction with the Honiden lab was showing up to the skyscraper which housed it, going up to the floor where the professor's office was located and finding a man sleeping on a couch in the corridor. I remember feeling like the tales I'd been told about Japan's working culture seemed to be very much true. Honiden was not in his office, but one of the other professors eventually found me looking confused in the corridor and took me down several floors to where the weekly seminar was happening.

Introductions were made, very awkwardly, and I felt like people weren't really aware that I was supposed to be there.
The Spanish PhD student asked me who my supervisor was, and laughed when I said Honiden. Apparently he didn't supervise students, but left that to the other professors. The Master's student presenting that week was briefly asked if he needed to do the presentation in English, and I still remember the fear in his face. 

I didn't understand much of the presentation. I think it was on mutation testing, which I think is a fairly interesting field. But I could tell that the tone of the questions being asked were... Let's just say hostile.
I read some (Google translated) transcripts afterwards, and would later attend the seminars where the foreign students presented in English, and it generally seemed like whoever was presenting would just be torn to shreds by the professors and the other students. 

I genuinely think this combative atmosphere is one of the major reasons I was put off pursuing research. But it certainly wasn't the only reason.

Eventually I was able to have a conversation with Professor Ishikawa, who drew the short straw of supervising me, and I learned that the website of the lab was very much out of date, And that the projects that I'd thought were interesting were no longer being worked on.
