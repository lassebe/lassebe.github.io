### Preface

If you're reading this and are planning to do an exchange semester/year in Japan. I'm always more than happy to chat about this stuff. Even if you just need someone to rant to.

I started my application sometime in February 2015. My memories are a bit hazy, and I'm not particularly keen to dig to deeply into them, because frankly, just looking at the number of emails back and forth have me slightly stressed out.

If you're going as part of the Graduate Programme at the school of Information Science and Technology, as I was, you need to be accepted by a supervisor and attached to a lab. Suffice to say, I was not particularly good at writing to professors, and I don't know if most of the emails I sent were ever read.
Because I was having no luck reaching any labs, I tried applying to the School of Interdisciplinary Information Science, but that fell through, because they require you to have taken the TOEFL as proof of your English abilities.
The University of Tokyo administration staff were extremely helpful, to their credit. They managed to wrangle a professor at the IST into accepting me. Though this also meant that I had no idea what I was really getting into before I went, which was a source of not inconsiderable anxiety.

Once I had the official acceptance from the University, I could proceed with all the fun paperwork and administration involved in actually getting the visa. I've blocked most of the process out of my memory, but suffice to say, I'm not looking forward to having to do any of that again.


### Being A Graduate Student - Sort Of

There's a major disconnect between the Master's Programme at KTH and Todai. At KTH, which I was familiar with, it's largely a continuation of your Bachelor's studies, with more idependent studies. The content is certainly more academic, you are more likely to read papers than a textbook, but the structure is still very much there. I'm a person who very much needs structure in order to be productive, or at least I was at the time. I think it depends on the context as well, but at least in an academic setting, I struggle without having a clear understanding of what is expected of me.

In comparision, the courses at UTokyo can be seen as an afterthought, the primary focus of grad students is research.
With my background, I had a very limited understanding of what academic research actually looks like. I think I was still toying with the idea that it was something I wanted to do. A notion that I didn't even fully manage to dispell even after my year in Tokyo.

I will say, I did not do a good job of making use of the opportunities I had while at Todai. But I also don't think I was particularly well-placed to make use of them, so I try not to kick myself too much about it.


My first interaction with the Honiden lab was showing up to the skyscraper which housed it, going up to the floor where the professor's office was located and finding a man sleeping on a couch in the corridor. I remember feeling like the tales I'd been told about Japan's working culture seemed to be very much true. Honiden was not in his office, but one of the other professors eventually found me looking confused in the corridor and took me down several floors to where the weekly seminar was happening.

Introductions were made, very awkwardly, and I felt like people weren't really aware that I was supposed to be there.
The Spanish PhD student asked me who my supervisor was, and laughed when I said Honiden. Apparently he didn't supervise students, but left that to the other professors. The Master's student presenting that week was briefly asked if he needed to do the presentation in English, and I still remember the fear in his face. 

I didn't understand much of the presentation. I think it was on mutation testing, which I think is a fairly interesting field. But I could tell that the tone of the questions being asked were... Let's just say hostile.
I read some (Google translated) transcripts afterwards, and would later attend the seminars where the foreign students presented in English, and it generally seemed like whoever was presenting would just be torn to shreds by the professors and the other students. 

I genuinely think this combative atmosphere is one of the major reasons I was put off pursuing research. But it certainly wasn't the only reason.

Eventually I was able to have a conversation with Professor Ishikawa, who drew the short straw of supervising me, and I learned that the website of the lab was very much out of date, And that the projects that I'd thought were interesting were no longer being worked on.

I generally didn't do a good job at engaging with the lab. I did make some friends, and had most of my day-to-day social interactions with the people sitting nearby me. But I never really collaborated much. It wasn't an easy place to break into, but I think it depends a lot on the people who are there, and it may well have changed. 

I did get a chance to join the lab's winter camp, a trip up to the absolutely stunning Hakone. I really felt my lack of Japanese at this point. But I was able to enjoy myself. I had so much fun with the testing competition, and actually managed to do pretty well! I had to prepare some kind of show for the party, and ended up just doing a bo-kata, which I think was well recieved enough. The hotel, the hot springs, and the food was amazing. I really appreciate that I got to join, it was one of the highlights of the year I spent in Tokyo.

I also managed to be a student volunteer at ICSE 2016 in Austin. Much to the suprise of both Honiden and Ishikawa when they met me there. Seeing an academic conference up close was also probably another thing that turned me away from academia in the long run. But I definitely appreciated having the opportunity.


### Courses - Such as they were

I had to scrape a bit to find courses given in English. I did definitely appreciate the chance to take some modules in other subjects like history and philosophy. 
But overall the quality of the courses were a bit all over the place. My biggest complaint would have been the lack of context. In many cases, the professor would show up, and just start talking from his slides, with no preface and no real indication of how anything fit together. For example, there was a course called Stochastic Methods in Mathematical Informatics, that to this day remains the most baffling hour and a half of my life. The professor was just writing out theorems for an hour and a half. I dropped that course after the first lecture.

The examination was also extremely varied. The worst offender was a course in Parallel and Distributed Computing Systems; I really enjoyed the content, even though it wasn't quite what I'd expected. But after the twelve lectures, we were given our first and only assignment: "Write a parallel program, and write a one page report on it.". 

I'm just going to go through each of the courses, some of them might still be given, and on the off-chance that someone is in the same situation that I was in, I'd like to give them just a bit more information than I had. Starting with some courses I didn't finish:

* 4820-1001 Stochastic Methods in Mathematical Informatics 
  I don't even know, according to some people who stayed, it was about using statistical methods to forecast stock markets? 

* 4860-1068 Physically Based Animation 
  A really good course covering lots of different techniques for computer based animation, with a focus on physics (gravity, lighting, etc.). I ended up dropping it because I missed some important deadlines while travelling, but it was probably the best structured course. The lecturer was really good as well.

* 4850-1007 Robotics
  Seemed to just be pure mathematics. I finally got bit by my lack of Multivariate Calculus. 

* 4810-1115 Parallel Numerical Computations
  A semi-rare instance of a course with lots of practical elements. Mostly focused around using MPI, and running on large supercomputers. I can't remember why I dropped this, I have vague memories of struggling in vain to get accounts set up.


Now for the ones I actually finished:

* Introduction to Philosophy
  An undergraduate course given by an enthusiastic professor. I mostly remember it covering ethics, and the problem of induction. He talked up the exam a lot, but it was nothing to write home about.

* Operations Research
  The only course I took given at the Komaba Campus. I appreciated learning about the Simplex method and how the computational complexity is at odds with its performance in practice. There were small weekly assignments, and I think there was even some programming involved. I think this was the only course that wasn't managed by email.

* Early Modern Philosophy 1: Rationalism (Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz)
  This was basically The Good Place, each week we'd read a text by the above mentioned philosophers, write some notes, and discuss it during a seminar. The reading was probably the most dense I've had to do. But the discussions were really nice and gave me more perspective. I also made a good friend thanks to this course. There was also a final essay where I wrote some real positivist rubbish. The professor was kind about it though.

* Information, Technology, and Society in Asia
  A history course given by the graduate school I was not allowed to apply to. I remember the lectures were quite late in the day, and that I sometimes struggled to stay awake. Which was a problem as there were not that many students in the class. But the content was really interesting, and I learnt a lot about the history of Asia that I was really ignorant of before. I also really appreciated the b≈çnenkai, where the head professor on the course told us about how he grew up as the third son on a farm, and how he'd learned English from the radio; and got told off for correcting his English teacher.

* Parallel and Distributed Computing Systems
  The lectures mostly talked about Dataflow Architecture, a subject that I'd never heard anything about before or since. But it was pretty neat. I just wish there'd been some exercises or something that could've helped solidify the content. Or even a textbook. As it stands I have some notes somewhere, that are not very understandable.

* Algorithmic Aspects of Communication
  Despite the slightly confusing name, I really really enjoyed this course. The professor, Francois Le Gall, had his lectures down to the last detail, and always finished exactly on time. The course covered focused mainly on Communication Complexity, which I hadn't heard much about before or since. But the proofs always felt very clever, and not too hard to wrap your head around.
  Until it was time to do the assignment for the course. I've never been so stumped by an algorithm problem, and because of the relative obscurity of the subject, it was really hard to learn more about independently. I gave it my best shot, and got a half-decent grade. I know Le Gall has since moved universities, and I doubt the course will be the same without him.

* Advanced Algorithms
  A very theoretical algorithm course, normally given by Francois Le Gall, but this year was given by another professor and his PhD student. There was some overlap between the undergraduate capstone course at KTH, and this one. But the final (and only) assignment was still a bit tricky. Mostly owing to my poor mathematical ability. But it went OK. I was pretty checked out by this point, as it was given in the summer semester and I'd realised that there was no point in worrying too much about my lack of academic achievements during the year.

* Seminar on Computer Science V
  I really wish that Todai would get someone to see over their course naming scheme. It turned out to be a cryptography course given by a newly arrived professor. I liked that he covered a lot of the practical aspects of how implementation mistakes can really break any and all security guarantees.
  I also very much appreciated that he started the first lecture by outlining the course, what he was going to cover, and how we would be evaluated (attendance and an exam).

* Verification of Computing Systems
  Probably my favourite course that I took while at Todai. It was given by three professors, including Cyrille Artho who would later supervise my Master's Thesis. The content included Temporal Logic and Model Checking, which was a nice continuation of the Logic course I'd taken during my second year. The course also contained a number of practical exercises that involved actual coding!

* Cognitive Multi-Media Processing
  Again with the course names. The course was basically just lectures where the professor talked about synesthesia, which admittedly is really cool. I also learned some basic linguistics from the course, like what phonemes are. But it was a slightly odd experience. I can't remember what the final paper was about.

* Internet Architecture
  Not much to say about this course, it mostly talked about actual infrastructure and IEEE networking standards.

* Special Lecture in Information Science and Technology VII
  Despite being named like it was an installment of a long running JRPG franchise, this was a really good course, given by Professor Robert Gl√ºck, a very cheerful man. It focused on Reverisble Computing, which is now my go to topic for short interesting trivia when talking to computer scientists. Gl√ºck did a really good job introducing the area, with all the relevant motivations, and showed that there are interesting considerations both in theory and practice. As charming as I found it all, it does definitely feel very academic, but I don't think there's anything wrong with that necessarily. There should be room for intellectual pursuits that aren't necessarily directly applicable, but are just plain interesting. If I hadn't gone down the Verification route, I probably would've considered doing my thesis on Reversible Computing.


### Summary - sort of

I really feel like I didn't make the most of the opportunities I had while I was at Todai.
And I'm slowly coming to terms with that. If I had to do it again; I would have studied Japanese. I would have committed to actually doing some research, or at least supporting one of the other students with their research. Or have gone the other way and explictly said that I wasn't doing it, rather than what I actually did of half-assing it, and reading a bunch of papers, without actually getting much from it.

What I really got out of spending a year over there was time to stand on my own for the first time, make a bunch of mistakes, meet a wonderful partner, and just experience a lot of new things. It certainly wasn't what I had planned or anticipated. But I think that's OK.
