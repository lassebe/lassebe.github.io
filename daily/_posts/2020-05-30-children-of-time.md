Trying for the random prompt just to see what it's like. Generated a random number between 3 and 599 to pick a page. I did have to scan the page to find something that made sense to write about.

I almost only read very light science fiction. I think the furthest I've gone in terms of "hard" sci-fi is Rendezvous with Rama by Arthur C. Clarke, and I couldn't really get into the very elaborate descriptions of rotational momentum. I visualise poorly at the best of times. 
But I do tend to enjoy it when authors have to get around the problem of interstellar travel at sub-lightspeed, and do so by sticking people in freezers. It was probably the only reasonable way to keep any human characters involved given the timescales the book covers.

I also really like the way the crew and the ship degrades over time in the story, and how the audience surrogate is repeatedly awoken to find the world around him having shifted quite drastically. The back-and-forth between Kern's world and _Gilgamesh_ is also really good at keeping the momentum going.

I've read a couple of Adrian Tchaikovsky's books: Children of Ruin, Dogs of War, and Cage of Souls. And what really sticks out in all of them (slightly less so in Cage of Souls) is his ability to write from the perspectives of non-human intelligences. Having said that, I do also really enjoy his human characters, even if they can sometimes feel like they're painted with broad strokes.

I am trying to stop myself from drawing parallels between the isolation on a spaceship and the current lockdown situation. It doesn't really feel comparable, and also it feels trite. But there's the acknowledgement that the thought did enter my head.

Would I want to go on an interstellar trip in cryosleep? I feel like if you'd asked me a few years ago I'd have said yes without any hesitation. There's definitely an appeal. And it feels like a lot of people would sign up, even if it had a significant risk of `freezing on some death-trap`. But the number of people who would get cold feet is probably also quite high. No pun intended.


I find dialogue fascinating. I don't think I've ever made a serious attempt at writing any myself. I feel like I'd spend an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out consistent voices for characters. And yet, of the top of my head, the main example I can think of is Nightblood from Sanderson's Cosmere. I know people criticise John Green for writing dialogue that "teens would never say". I don't think it jumped out at me when reading The Fault in Our Stars. Might be something to look at.
