### Mathematics

As mentioned before, most students at KTH tend to struggle with Mathematics initially. As such, there are a lot of resources and intitiatives to try and mitigate the shock. There are summer courses for people who are about to start, which I started, but never finish, so they're still in my transcript as unfinished. 

The school of Computer Science and Communcation, which now has been merged to become the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, also ran another introductory course during the first few weeks. 

On top of that the Computer Science Programme also has yet another Introduction to Mathematics course, which students take before starting Calculus. I think this slow burn probably helps quite a lot to level the field and give students a better chance at absorbing concepts. At the time I think I kept worrying that we were just putting off the really difficult stuff, and the fact that I was doing OK in the intro courses didn't actually matter.

This is almost eight years ago now, so my memories are undoubtably warped. But from what I remember the hardest part about shifting to university mathematics was formalism. We'd learned derivatives and integrals in primary education, but only as an operational exercise. Actually drilling down to defintions, and understanding why the precise language of limits mattered took a while.

I do remember it all feeling exciting though.

Calculus was followed by Linear Algebra, a course infamous for its high failure rate. The lecturer was the amazingly sweet [Olof Heden](https://people.kth.se/~olohed/lifesummary.html). We saw him around campus a few times even after he retired, and he was always very kind.

During my first year I still attended pretty much all lectures, exercise sessions, and made several attempts at actually doing the reading ahead of time. When I did, it was always extremely enlightening, but at the same time it made the lectures a lot less useful, because they largely covered the reading again. Probably because the lecturer correctly assumed that most people don't do the reading. The most useful thing I did was probably watching Khan Academy. It's an absolutely amazing resource.


### Computer Science

I'd taken a few courses in High/Secondary School, using C++. But I arguably had more bad habits to unlearn than anything else. I was very sloppy, a habit I feel like I've mostly gotten over, but it still rears it head every once in a while.

The Intro to CS course was a full third of the first year, and was made up of weekly lectures, and exercise sessions. It starts out with teaching programming and Object Orientation in Java, and then shifts to Algorithms and Data-Structures. It's generally people's favourite course during the first year, and I think it does a fairly good job at level-setting even for people with some previous experience.

### Others

The autumn semester also contained a course titled "Communication in Engineering Sciences" which got a bad wrap for mostly being essay writing and presentations. I don't remember much of it, apart from people complaining about it. 

My most salient memory is walking through a snowstorm to the other side of campus to give an oral presentation, and being completely soaked once I got there. I still do not particularly like public speaking.

I remember I wrote an essay on Ubiqutious Computing, a concept I found extremely exciting when described by idealistic researchers. I would later be disappointed to find out that it's mostly used for advertising, or [devices of dubious usefulness](https://twitter.com/internetofshit).

During the spring we had a course in Human-Computer Interaction. I really appreciate the fact that we were introuced to user-centered design early on, and being able to work with [great UX designers](https://twitter.com/jbroring) is one of the favourite parts of my current job. Having said that, I definitely didn't enjoy having to try and interview strangers in public. Being a massive introvert, and Swedes generally not enjoying being approached at random was a bad combination.
The course was structured as a competition, and I remember other groups tactically voting for our group so that they wouldn't have to do an additional presentation.

We were also the first year to have a mandatory course in Sustainable Development. The course definitely had some growing pains, and while it was well-meaning, it marked the fourth or fifth time I'd seen 'An Incovenient Truth'. The course had a project section which was largely based on trying to apply computer science to aid sustainable development. The course has rightfully been moved later in the curriculum, when people have a stronger background and can actually build something, rather than just hypothesize. 

There was also a seminar course that every Computer Science student takes, where students from different years write an essay once per quarter and meets to discuss topics related to the programme. I think it's a pretty great idea, and while most people phone in the essays, the seminars were a good opportunity to meet people from other years and get some insight into what was to come. It turns out, most complaints tend to be pretty consistent year to year.
