>There were a lot of looks from the rest of Key Crew at that remark, some frowning, others plainly sharing his opinion - including even one of the security team. It was a rare moment when Holsten would far rather be in the minority.

Another _Gilgamesh_ chapter, hundreds of pages, and hundreds if not thousands of years within the timeline of the story. And Holsten has yet again been woken up to find things just a bit worse than when he last when under the ice. I remember these parts of the book as being a minority, but I'm curious to see how many times I end up landing on them by chance.

Being in the minority is generally not a comfortable feeling. It might be a useful thing to experience more often. An instance that comes to mind is when I parted ways with the organisation running summer camps for teens that I was a part of for a few years growing up.

I still have very fond memories of my time both as a participant and as a "camp counselor". It was probably the first time I was in a position of responsibility, and I remember taking it seriously, in my own way. I enjoyed being able to have, what felt at the time, deep discussions with my peers, and adults, about philosophical subjects without having a religious backdrop. And I do think that was a real contributor to my personal growth in many ways.

The reason I ended up parting ways with the organisation was largely influenced by one of the original members that I have a lot of respect for. He, and some others, felt that many aspects of the camps were creating situations that could be described as insular, and slightly cultish. There were lots of ritual, nothing formal; but in-jokes, traditions, and customs that had been brought in by various people over the years, and had been organically made part of the experience.

Furthermore, there were many instances of young people coming from severely troubled backgrounds, who ended up sharing details of their lives in very intimate settings. Which no doubt could have been helpful for many of them. But we, the staff, were by and large not trained to properly deal with trauma, particularly not to the degree which some of the people had gone through.

So the person I admire, and a few others, wrotes these thoughts in something of a manifesto. Declaring that they could no longer be a part of organising the camps, unless significant changes were made. I felt strongly that their concerns were very valid, and I was troubled by them. But I was definitely in the minority, and while I tried to stick around, the cognitive dissonance became to much for me.

It was a very amicable parting of ways, and like I mentioned I still keep in contact with many of the people who stayed involved.
