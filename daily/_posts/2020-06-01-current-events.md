Continuing on the same quote from yesterday. On the topic of another minority.

It feels wrong to do any kind of public creation, even one that few - if any - are likely to see, and not at least acknowledge the events going on in the US at the moment.

You could say there are always such events. Or that the US, despite their exceptionalism, should not be given more weight than events in other part of the world, particularly those outside of the West.

With that said, I still want to say that I fully support the efforts of the Black folks who are trying to dismantle the racist system that literally is killing them in the streets. Black Lives Matter.
