Quick acknowledgement that these daily posts are very much not daily.

I have conflicting feelings about my third year, on some levels it was a period of intense personal growth, I probably learned more than I have before or since.

But it was also extremely difficult. I'm fairly certain I burnt out at one point. I was definitely not pulling my weight towards the end of that year, and I still feel [guilty about that](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-29-05:46.html) to this day. My friend who I was primarily working with called me out at one point, and I still get a pit in my stomach when I think about that. I also lost him some extra credit in the Computer Security course by getting cold feet during a presentation, and not delivering a demo I'd prepared. 
I'm very grateful that he forgave me, and that we continued to work together in the spring, in spite of all of that. Generally, I owe him a ton. I wouldn't have gotten involved with half the things that I did if it wasn't for him doing it first. 

I also took my first stab at working as a Teaching Assistant, and if you're a former student of mine reading this, I'm sorry.
Another thing I feel guilty about is my haphazard approach to running exercise sessions. I justified it to myself by convincing myself that the primary purpose of the sessions was for the students to present their work, and even if I still think that's broadly speaking true, it doesn't really excuse that I ended classes massively early. 
I did enjoy helping when students would reach out, but I recognise that the ones that didn't might have also needed more support. Grading was a mixed bag, on the one hand it was amazing to see different solutions, on the other hand it was hard work.
My favourite part of the job was working with [Ric Glassey](https://www.kth.se/profile/glassey?l=en), helping him get settled in, and doing some of the groundwork for shifting the course to GitHub.

Anyway let's break it down by semesters again.


### Reception

Each year the different student chapters at KTH conduct a series of events for incoming students. 
This is known as the Reception. It has a complicated past. It used to contain lots of things that would be recognised in the US as hazing rituals. 
Those aspects have since been removed, and while some of the historical trappings remain, it's a completely different beast. 

I would refer to much of it as slightly cultish; the Reception has it's own vocabulary, and lots of ceremonies and rituals. But I don't think that's necessarily a negative thing, it does create something entirely unique, and there are always more people who want to get involved each year. And I know from experience that the people who organise it tend to think critically about the whole affair, and care a lot about making it a good experience for everyone. 

I also think the "cultish" elements help with bringing people together to work extremely hard for free. During the final event the staff is basically working 24 hours, and I don't think you could do that without a certain level of camraderie.

Anyway, that's how I ended up attending an important faculty meeting wearing [cerise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerise_(color)) overalls.


### Autumn

The major course taken in the last year of the CS Bachelor's programme is known as Algorithms, Data-Structures, and Complexity, it is a mix of theory and practical labs. Going into it I was apprenhensive, I'd probably built it up to much, but it felt like a course that it was important to do well in. The course covers quite a lot, particularly in terms of fundamental theory of computability and complexity. 
I look back at it now as an extremely well-structured and thought out course. The lecturer cares a lot about pedagogy, and has used the course as a testing ground for initiatives that were later picked up by other parts of the programme.


There was also a Discrete Math course that was a real reality check. Looking back at it, I still don't understand why it was so hard.
