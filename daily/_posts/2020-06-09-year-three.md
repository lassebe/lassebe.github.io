Quick acknowledgement that these daily posts are very much not daily.

I have conflicting feelings about my third year, on some levels it was a period of intense personal growth, I probably learned more than I have before or since.

But it was also extremely difficult. I'm fairly certain I burnt out at one point. I was definitely not pulling my weight towards the end of that year, and I still feel [guilty about that](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-29-05:46.html) to this day. My friend who I was primarily working with called me out at one point, and I still get a pit in my stomach when I think about that. I also lost him some extra credit in the Computer Security course by getting cold feet during a presentation, and not delivering a demo I'd prepared. 
I'm very grateful that he forgave me, and that we continued to work together in the spring, in spite of all of that. Generally, I owe him a ton. I wouldn't have gotten involved with half the things that I did if it wasn't for him doing it first. 

I also took my first stab at working as a Teaching Assistant, and if you're a former student of mine reading this, I'm sorry.
Another thing I feel guilty about is my haphazard approach to running exercise sessions. I justified it to myself by convincing myself that the primary purpose of the sessions was for the students to present their work, and even if I still think that's broadly speaking true, it doesn't really excuse that I ended classes massively early. 
I did enjoy helping when students would reach out, but I recognise that the ones that didn't might have also needed more support. Grading was a mixed bag, on the one hand it was amazing to see different solutions, on the other hand it was hard work.
My favourite part of the job was working with [Ric Glassey](https://www.kth.se/profile/glassey?l=en), helping him get settled in, and doing some of the groundwork for shifting the course to GitHub.

I still cared about my grades at this point. Mostly because they were valuable for the exchange studies. The selection is based on GPA, or at least it was at the time.

Anyway let's break it down by semesters again.


### Reception

Each year the different student chapters at KTH conduct a series of events for incoming students. 
This is known as the Reception. It has a complicated past. It used to contain lots of things that would be recognised in the US as hazing rituals. 
Those aspects have since been removed, and while some of the historical trappings remain, it's a completely different beast. 

I would refer to much of it as slightly cultish; the Reception has it's own vocabulary, and lots of ceremonies and rituals. But I don't think that's necessarily a negative thing, it does create something entirely unique, and there are always more people who want to get involved each year. And I know from experience that the people who organise it tend to think critically about the whole affair, and care a lot about making it a good experience for everyone. 

I also think the "cultish" elements help with bringing people together to work extremely hard for free. During the final event the staff is basically working 24 hours, and I don't think you could do that without a certain level of camraderie.

Anyway, that's how I ended up attending an important faculty meeting wearing [cerise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerise_(color)) overalls.


### Autumn

The major course taken in the last year of the CS Bachelor's programme is known as Algorithms, Data-Structures, and Complexity, it is a mix of theory and practical labs. Going into it I was apprenhensive, I'd probably built it up to much, but it felt like a course that it was important to do well in. The course covers quite a lot, particularly in terms of fundamental theory of computability and complexity. 
I look back at it now as an extremely well-structured and thought out course. The lecturer cares a lot about pedagogy, and has used the course as a testing ground for initiatives that were later picked up by other parts of the programme.


There was also a Discrete Math course that was a real reality check. Looking back at it, I still don't understand exactly why it was so hard. It certainly covered a lot of material: Number theory, graphs, group theory and some abstract algebra.
Part of me wants to go back and try to actually go through the material again, but I doubt that'll actually happen.

We also took the Computer Security course, which was a pretty good introduction, and primarily taught me to have a healthy paranoia. And that being aware of the basics is a good start. The final course I took covered C++, and I mostly remember it being a lot of work. And that we had an amazing TA who was on the C++ committee in between his career as a model.


### Spring

After a very tough fall, the spring was once again quite a relief. This was probably the main semester where I felt on top of things, and that I had the most room to learn without being in a pressure cooker.

I took a course in Decision Theory from the Philosophy department, which I have very fond memories of. It was the most interdisciplinary course I'd taken thus far, with people from lots of different backgrounds. We probably didn't engage enough in the discussion sessions, much to the chagrin of the lecturer. But the content was interesting, and it just felt like a really nice intellectual exercise. 

Another elective was a graduate level course on Program Semantics, that I by rights should not have passed. I didn't realise it at the time, but I really am not very good at formalism. I have a feeling the lecturer was easy on the grades because the course is only given every other year, and he didn't want additional work. The course did serve me well later on in Japan, as a foundation for some of the Reversible Computing I learned about there. It's also been very helpful when reading papers on various related subjects. 

The final course I took was a mandatory Operating Systems course. I feel like the lecturer had a lot of good ideas, but somehow the execution didn't really work. For example, the final exam was designed to be more about principles, and reasoning. Which I think is an admirable goal. But when around half of the cohort fail the exam year after year, I have to wonder if it's a structural problem, rather than all the students just being incompetent. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. I scraped by, by the skin of my teeth.

Our Bachelor's Thesis ended up being a very small incremental piece on top of some work on distributed graphs, with some very generous help from the original Italian researchers. My favourite piece of peer feedback was: "It felt short, but I also can't point to anything that's missing". I very much enjoyed being able to go to Japan, and still work on it remotely. Something that played out again with my Master's Thesis.


### Closing

Looking back at it, this is probably the year when I did the most things. Given the opportunity to do it again, I would have been more defensive about my time, and prioritised better as to not be a burden to other people. I'm very grateful to the support I had from everyone around me, and I hope I was able to support them as well.
