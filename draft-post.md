Revisiting my degree.

I saw another thread on the utility of a degree in Computer Science the other day, and I felt like taking the opportunity of writing an n+1 post of my own experiences.
Self-indulgent? Yes. Useful for someone? Possibly.

### Context

At time of writing, I'm a software engineer at VMware Pivotal Labs, who's been working full-time for about two years. 

As a Swedish citizen, my university education was free. I continued to live with my parents for the first three years of university, without paying rent, which meant that I was able to live off of grants, rather than taking loans.

During my fourth year I spent a year at the University of Tokyo, which I'm going to try and gloss over in this post to cover more in detail in a separate post. After coming home to Sweden I spent a year and a half living in student accomodation with one of my closest friends. During this time I took loans which landed me with 163,219 SEK (roughly $17,600 or £14,000). 
Compared to debts in other countries, and the extremely low interest rates, this feels like a very small cost.

### Computer Science in Engineering

I was admitted to my first choice of university and programme, based on my results on "Högskoleprovet" (think SAT) rather than my grades.
It is a five year combined Bachelor's and Master's. After the first three years you pick a Master's programme, we got guaranteed admittance to the Computer Science Master, but you are able to pick other ones if you take the right courses.

The school has a long history of engineering programmes, and takes a lot of pride in that.


### Programme Content

The syllabus is continously changing and adapting as faculty changes, national requirements come in, and student preferences affect the programme. 

But the general shape of the Bachelor's programme was made up like this when I went there:

40% Computer science courses
30% Mathematics
30% Others

I have things I could say about pretty much every course I took, but I'll try to be slightly more brief.
