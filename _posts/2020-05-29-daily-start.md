Inspired by a thread by [@DRMaciver](https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1265999120042467329).

Now feels like a good a time as any to attempt starting new habits.

Writing is something that I tend to enjoy when actually take the time to do it.
I don't think I'm particularly good at it, but I feel like I could improve.

The random prompts that DRMaciver suggested does really tickle my brain,
but I think I'll save those for days when I struggle to write.

Other topics that have been rolling around in my head for years, that would most likely benefit from being formed into actual sentences:

* The various "cults" I've spent much of my life involved with. Communities might be a better descriptor than cults.
* Some rants on higher education/academic environments. Some overlap with the former.
* Formal methods, specifically model checking.
