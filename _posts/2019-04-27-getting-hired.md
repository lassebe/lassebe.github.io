Some background. Around August 2018 I started my Master’s thesis, the final step towards my degree that I’d started on 6 years earlier. Some of my classmates had already finished their thesis before the summer; I decided to extend my studies by an extra semester to get some more coursework, following a year in Tokyo which was extremely educational in a lot of ways, but not necessarily what I wanted/needed academically.

While working on my thesis I applied to a lot of companies. According to LinkedIn I applied to some 57 jobs, and I know that I sent a decent amount of applications outside of that platform as well. A lot of these went into the black hole of resumes, which is to be expected. 

Now, I came through a university with a pretty strong pedigree, at least nationally, of producing good engineers. I had fairly good academic results, a recent internship, held a couple of teaching assistant jobs while at university. And I’m a white cis-male who dresses mostly in hoodies. I got a fair number of interviews from these applications.

I bombed most of them. Despite performing well in one of the more comprehensive undergraduate courses on algorithms in Europe. I am terrible at algorithmic, whiteboard-style, interviews. I was aware that this was fairly standard practice in the industry, but I think I vastly underestimated how badly I’d perform when put on the spot. I did slightly better on Hackerrank and take-home assignment interviews. Though most of those were followed up by whiteboard interviews.

To be fair, I also failed a lot of other interviews. For example, in one interview I was asked a variation on the classic “What happens when you type in a URL in your browser and hit Enter?”. I fumbled through an explanation, name-dropping the involved protocols, and tried to remember the point of ARP. But it was pretty clear that I’d made a mess of things. I [found this explanation](https://dev.to/nicolasmesa/what-happens-when-you-type-a-url-in-your-browser-and-press-enter-1iif) to be pretty good.

The rejection that stung the most was one from a company that I’d gotten really invested in. I had a great first interview with the CTO of the company, who simply asked me what I was working on at the moment, and kept digging into my understanding through asking questions. Even when I felt like he knew the answers himself, he seemed genuinely interested. After that I was given a take-home assignment, which was fairly well-scoped and interesting. I thought I’d created a decent solution, but after a call with an engineer where we talked through my design decisions, I was told that they felt I needed more production experience. With the benefit of hindsight, I agree with them. Despite the fact that the rejection hurt, I was happy with the process. I’d been able to show what I knew in a way that felt comfortable, and I’d learnt some things from the interview itself.

I did get some offers in the end though. They ended up varying wildly in terms of compensation (the highest salary was 53% higher than the lowest). I didn’t end up negotiating, which I think would make [patio11 unhappy](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/). But at that point I felt the offer was fair, and I honestly didn’t want to risk anything. Even though, I’m confident they would have handled it like professionals. It’s much easier to tell someone else to stick to their guns.

If you’re in a similar position, I’d recommend checking out [this repo](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards) for a list of companies that don’t use whiteboard style interviews. I won’t talk too much about the interview process of the company I ended up going with. I don’t want to shill too much. But if you’re curious, I’m happy to talk about it. Suffice to say, it worked better for me.
